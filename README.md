#DroneHive
This is the **DroneHive** app. Link [HERE.](https://arcane-mountain-8566.herokuapp.com) The web app is designed for **drone fleet management** by those operating fleets of drones of various sizes, in both private and public sectors. The rising adoption of drones represents a net benefit to society.  Although implications to business models, regulation and ethics are key to understand. This is a MEAN stack app with two models, Users and Drones.  Full CRUD on Drones, Create on Users.  User authentication.

###TOOLS USED
1. MongoDB
2. ExpressJS
3. AngularJS
4. NodeJS
5. D3 (data visualization)

###WHAT YOU WILL NEED 
1. npm install
2. enjoy the app

###USER STORY
1. Sign up for an account
2. Input your new Log In details
3. Select "New Drone" and create a few drones
4. Be sure to include the first two fields, they are "required"
5. In order to display the bar chart on each users "My Drone Board" page, be sure to include "altitude" per drone

###WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IN THE FUTURE
1. Add Google Map API.  To display location data of each drone.  Either capturing data via User upload and displaying on static map.  The potential is someday incorporating GPS data and do live drone tracking. More dependencies here of course.
2. Capture more data on drones per user in JSON.  Allow for data upload files.
3. Displaying more data w/D3 to create a robust "dashboard" for Users' drone fleet performance
4. Displaying more data w/D3 to create an open feedback forum. Search & sort functionality.
5. Add Update & Delete on Users
6. Allow for viewing 360 video VR live streaming
